Hi!, I'm Arun, currently doing my Ph.D. studies under the supervision of [Dr. Paul Rad](https://secureaiautonomylab.github.io/) at [University of Texas at San Antonio](https://www.utsa.edu/) and working as an applied AI research fellow at Secure AI and Autonomy Laboratory and [Open Cloud Institute](https://opencloud.utsa.edu/). My primary research focus is in building explainable AI (XAI) algorithms for human behavior research.

My Work and Research
======
My research interests are in the areas of artificial intelligence, computer vision, distributed and parallel computing, cloud computing, and computer architecture. Specifically, I am interested in bridging the gap between the theory and real-world practical implementations of deep learning algorithms in healthcare. However, due to the blackbox nature of deep learning algorithms, we are still wary of practical implementations of AI. One aspect of my research is in dealing with this - to explain the decisions of AI-based algorithms to generate explainable and accurate models for healthcare. Another aspect of my research is in real-world implementations of these algorithms using edge devices and cloud computing backends. Towards this goal, I use various wearble devices to collect physiological data for automated analysis of diseaes using deep learning algorithms. Both data and results are piped to cloud backends which provides a scalable distributed deep learning architecture for healthcare.

My Prior Education and Background
======
I received the Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Cochin University of Science and Technology](https://www.cusat.ac.in/), Kerala, India, in 2013 and the M.S. degree in Computer Engineering from the [University of Texas at San Antonio](https://www.utsa.edu/), San Antonio, TX, USA in 2016. I was a recipient of the [UTSA Brain Health Consortium](https://www.utsa.edu/bhc/) Graduate Student Seed Grant in 2020 for my proposal in expanding the horizons of behavior analytics for children with neurotypical disabilities. I am a member of the IEEE, and IEEE Eta Kappa Nu honor society.

My Hobbies and Extra-Curricular Activities
======
I enjoy photography and drawing. You can find my instagram link under my picture if you'd like to connect. I also love to be outdoors and enjoy the greenery - which is where I find a unity with nature and within myself.
